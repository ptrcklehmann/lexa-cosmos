                        I was very proud to take part in the Global Social Protection Week in 2019, which was organised by the International Labour Organisation, where I was in charge of designing all the visual material used at the event. My work being appreciated and being tasked with creating design solutions for an organisation that aims to make the world a better place was a thrilling experience.

                        Lately, most likely I would easily be caught listening to weekly podcasts in order to stay tuned. The one that most stroke me lately was the Developer Tea's Detaching to Seek an Outside View. where the host,Jonathan Cutrell, talks about the importance and the challenges of placing ourselves inside other's perspective when testing our products. To utterly leave our inside view and be able to to really imagine how someone else's take on our application is a rather difficult task that requires a lot of practice.
