## Task 0

- What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but we’d love to know why you’re proud of it.
- Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it as well.
